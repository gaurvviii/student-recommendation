# Student Performance Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive tool for analyzing and visualizing student performance based on quiz data. The `Student Performance Analysis Dashboard` uses Python and Streamlit to provide insightful visualizations, statistics, and recommendations to help educators and students understand their performance trends, strengths, and areas of improvement.

## Features

- **Student Performance Overview**: Displays key metrics for individual students such as average accuracy, total questions attempted, and number of quizzes taken.
- **Topic Performance Analysis**: Offers detailed insights into a student's performance by topic, including average accuracy and number of attempts.
- **Time-based Performance Trends**: Visualizes performance trends over time and provides rolling averages for better insights.
- **Question Distribution**: Shows the distribution of correct answer ratios across quizzes taken.
- **Performance Insights**: Generates actionable insights based on overall performance, trends, and topic-specific performance.
- **Recommendations**: Provides suggestions for improvement in weak topics based on student performance.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For data processing and performance analysis.
- **Streamlit**: For building the interactive web dashboard.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For generating visualizations (charts and plots).
- **Datetime**: For handling timestamps in submission data.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- `pip` package manager

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
https://github.com/gaurvviii/student-recommendation.git
cd student-recommendation
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended) and activate it.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment (optional)
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# Mac/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install the required dependencies using pip.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Place the data files

Ensure the following JSON files are placed in the `data/` directory:

- `quiz_data.json`
- `submission_data.json`
- `historical_data.json`

If you don't have these files, make sure they are correctly generated or sourced from your application.

### 4. Run the application

To start the Streamlit app, run the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will launch the application in your default browser.

## Approach

### Data Loading

The application loads data from three JSON files: `quiz_data.json`, `submission_data.json`, and `historical_data.json`. The data is parsed into dictionaries and lists and then processed for further analysis.

### Submission Data Processing

Each student's quiz performance is processed to extract metrics such as accuracy, final score, correct answers, incorrect answers, total questions, quiz topic, and submission date. This information is organized into a Pandas DataFrame for further analysis.

### Performance Analysis

- **Topic Performance**: The performance metrics are aggregated by topic to determine the average accuracy, number of attempts, and other related statistics.
- **Trend Analysis**: Time series data is used to track performance over time, with a 7-day rolling average to smooth out fluctuations.
- **Question Distribution**: The ratio of correct answers to total questions is calculated and visualized to understand how students perform relative to the total number of questions.

### Visualizations

The app provides several interactive visualizations:
- **Bar Chart**: Displays average accuracy by topic.
- **Time Series Plot**: Visualizes performance over time.
- **Histogram**: Shows the distribution of correct answer ratios.
- **Rolling Average**: Smooths the time series data for trend analysis.

### Insights and Recommendations

The app generates insights based on overall performance, such as trends in accuracy, as well as specific topic performance. It also provides personalized recommendations for students, highlighting weak topics and suggesting strategies for improvement.

## Conclusion

This tool helps both educators and students track quiz performance, identify areas for improvement, and provides data-driven recommendations to enhance learning outcomes. By using the interactive dashboard, users can easily explore performance trends, topic-wise analysis, and make informed decisions on improving learning strategies.
